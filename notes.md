# Think how to predict content absorpion

Current conclusion:
 • There is no need to use motivation to predict behavior as of yet, because:
   - i don't know if motivation will be a factor in dicerning between pursuing predicted ocurrences and suggested occurrences
   > for now i'm implemeting the content absorption predictor to see what happens
   > and then continuous synchronization system

Implemented Predictors:

  - Time of the day prediction

  - Weekly amount prediction is OK (when there is no previous data)
  - Weekly frequency prediction is OK (when there is no previous data)

# É possível relacionar uma força de carater com motivação (atual, passada e futura) de um indivíduo para executar um comportamento?

## Definição de força de carater:

> Character strengths are the psychological ingredients — processes or mechanisms — that define the virtues.
> Said another way, they are distinguishable routes to displaying one or another of the virtues.


## Testando Love of Learning:

# Definition 1: general individual difference
# Definition 2: a universal but individually varying predisposition to engage particular content (e.g., Latin, videogames, music) or well-developed individual interest (Renninger, 1990, 2000).

! TODO list love of learning processes, constructs and mechanisms
### Conceptual dimensions of some constructs: (how do conceptual dimensions of some constructs of love of learning relates to motivation?)

Rather than list all measures that may include some items that reflect love of learning, some examples of measures are identified here in terms of the theoretical traditions in which they have emerged

## Measure: Motivational orientation
Intrinsinc: indicates high love of learning,
• provides challenge
• satisfies curiosity
• creates interest
• creates enjoyment
• I enjoy tackling problems that are completely new to me
• The intrinsic motivation scale includes two subscales, enjoyment and challenge
• intrinsic motives to know
• intrinsic motives to accomplish things
• intrinsic motives to experience stimulation

Extrinsic: high or low levels of extrinsic motives does not reflect any possesion of love of learning

## Measure: Competence

These measures tend to reflect several kinds of competence-related dimensions, including perceptions of one’s capacities and abilities (Bandura, 1986; Marsh, Craven, & Debus, 1991); achievement motivation, or the importance a person attaches to achieving competence in general or specific to a domain (Helmreich & Spence, 1978; Jackson, 1974); the meaning of achieving (or failing to achieve) competence for self-worth (Harter 1998); and the kind of achievement goals a person adopts in a particular learning context (Butler, 1987; Dweck, 1986; Harackiewicz, Barron, Carter, Tauer, & Elliot, 2000; Midgley et al., 1998; Nicholls, 1984). To experience love of learning, researchers studying competence suggest, people must feel (or expect to feel) some sense of competence and efficacy in the learning process; that is, they must feel that they are mastering a skill, filling in the gaps in their knowledge, and so on.


## Measure: Value


## Measure: Well-developed interest.
Well-developed individual interest is characterized by a person’s ongoing and ever deepening cognitive and affective relation with particular content; as such it mirrors the more general strength, love of learning




### Processes: (how do processes of love of learning relates to motivation?)


### Mechanisms: (how do mechanisms of love of learning relates to motivation?)
